# CoffeeCanvas
The Coffee Shop Web Application is a user-friendly platform that allows customers to register, log in, browse a coffee menu, add items to their cart, update and view their cart, and place orders. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and stores user data, coffee menu items, and order information in a SQL Server database.
